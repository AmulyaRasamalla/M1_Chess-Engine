# M1_Chess-Engine
Chess Engine
- In computer chess, a chess engine is a computer program that analyzes chess or chess variant positions, and generates a move or list of moves that it regards as strongest. A chess engine is usually a back end with a command-line interface with no graphics or windowing.
- So the project focuses on building the Chess Engine with the help of C Language.
